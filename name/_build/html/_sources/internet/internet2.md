# Internet Basics 2

## Diving Deeper

Now that we've acquainted ourselves with some basic networking concepts and commands, let's dive deeper into the workings of the internet city.

1. **Domain Name System (DNS):**
   - In our internet city, buildings can also have friendly names, like “Baker’s Shop,” instead of just numerical addresses. The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the city's directory that translates these friendly names to numerical IP addresses. So, when you want to visit "Baker’s Shop," DNS tells you the numerical address of the building.

2. **Subnetting and CIDR Notation:**
   - Subnetting is like dividing our city into various neighborhoods, making it easier to navigate. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a compact way to represent a neighborhood's address and size, like saying “The Elm Street Neighborhood covers buildings 1 to 100.”

3. **Firewalls:**
   - Firewalls act like security guards at the doors (ports) of your building, checking the identification of everyone coming in or going out to ensure they are allowed to pass.

4. **VPN (Virtual Private Network):**
   - A VPN is like a private tunnel in our city that lets you travel to other buildings securely, without being seen by others.

5. **TCP/IP Model:**
   - The TCP/IP model is the set of rules that govern how buildings in our internet city communicate. It's like the city's building code and traffic laws rolled into one.

## Address Resolution and Network Security

1. **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):**
   - We've already discussed ARP as the helper that finds a building's color (MAC Address) using its nameplate (IP Address). It's crucial for ensuring letters (data) reach the right buildings in our city.

2. **Cache:**
   - The concept of Cache is like having a small notebook where the postal service jots down frequently visited addresses, making it quicker to deliver letters in the future.

3. **Network Adapter:**
   - The Network Adapter is like having a car or a bicycle that allows you to travel on the city's roads (network cables) and visit different buildings or send and receive letters.
