# Linux for Ethical Hackers

## Installations
There are two ways to run linux:
- Virtual Machine
- Hard Install on to YOu computer

We will use a virtual machine for this textbook.

Follow the following steps to do so:

*Note: These steps have been adapted from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-installations). However, we make some important changes in this tutorial, so please follow along here.*

### Step 1: Download VirtualBox and Kali Linux

Installing a VM is a simple process. This guide uses Oracle's VirtualBox program to create and run the VM. This program is open-source, free, and simple. What more can you ask for? Now, let's make sure we have everything downloaded and ready for installation.

#### IMPORTANT

Once you have completed these instructions, **you are expected to work entirely in the VM.** Maximize the window, add more virtual monitors if you have them, fire up the Internet Browser in the **Whisker Menu** <img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/00_whisker_icon.png" alt="The blue-white rodent Whisker Menu Icon" style="display: inline; margin: auto;"> on the top left of the desktop. You should not be using anything outside of the VM while working on The Odin Project. If you feel like you have a good understanding after using the VM for a while, and or want to improve your experience, we recommend dual-booting Ubuntu, which there are instructions for below.

#### Step 1.1: Download VirtualBox

[Click here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and download VirtualBox for Windows hosts.

#### Step 1.2: Download Kali Linux

Head over to the official kali download page for [virtual machines](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines).

You will see icons for downloading Kali images for differnet virtual machines, since we are using VirtualBox click on the icon circled in red:

![Alt text](images/kali_install.png)

### Step 2: Install VirtualBox and set up Xubuntu

#### Step 2.1: Install VirtualBox

Installing VirtualBox is very straightforward. It doesn’t require much technical knowledge and is the same process as installing any other program. Double clicking the downloaded VirtualBox file will start the installation process.

If you receive an error about needing Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable Package, you can find it on [official Microsoft Learn page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022). You most likely want the version with `X64` Architecture (that means 64-bit) - download and install it then try installing VirtualBox again.

Make sure you install the application on `C:` drive, as it has tendency to error out otherwise. The virtual machine itself can be installed anywhere but we'll get to that soon.
As the software installs, the progress bar might appear to be stuck; just wait for it to finish.

#### Step 2.2: Prepare VirtualBox for Xubuntu

Now that you have VirtualBox installed, launch the program. Once open, you should see the start screen.

   ![The VirtualBox start screen](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/03_start_screen.png)

Click on the **New** button to create a virtual operating system. Give it a name of **Xubuntu**, if you want the VM installed somewhere else than default `C:` location, change that accordingly in the **Folder** option. This is the place where your virtual disk will reside, so make sure that you've got at least 30GB for that. In **ISO Image** choose **Other** - you'll see a window open for you to find the `.iso` file on your PC. It most likely is in the `Downloads` folder. Leave **Skip Unattended Installation** as it is.

   ![Half of the options being greyed out is normal. Don't worry about it.](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/04_install_start.png)

Continue by pressing **Next** and follow the next steps:

#### Step 2.2.1: Unattended guest OS install setup

You should see a window like this one now:

   ![No need to worry about the Product Key.](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/05_unattended_install.png)

You want to tick the **Guest Additions** and **Install in Background** options and also change your **Username** and **Password** fields to your liking. Note that your username must be all lower-case and no more than 32 characters. If you forget to change the default password, it will be `changeme`. Leave the **Guest Additions ISO**, **Hostname** and **Domain Name** as they are. Continue by pressing **Next**.


#### Step 2.2.2: Hardware

   ![You might be tempted to give your VM more than 2 processors. Don't.](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/06_hardware.png)

In the **Hardware** section of the installation you want to set your **Base Memory** to at least 2048 MB or more if possible - the upper limit is half of your total RAM but 4096 MB with the settings we recommend should give you a smooth experience.

For example, if you have 8 GB (8192 MB respectively) of RAM, you could allocate up to 4096 MB (1024 MB to 1 GB) to your VM’s operating system. If you do not know how much RAM is available to you, [please run this Google query](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+find+out+how+much+ram+you+have) to learn how to find this out. If the VM runs a bit slow, try allocating more memory!

_(__note:__ Difficulty converting your **G**iga**B**ytes into **M**ega**B**ytes? 1 GB of RAM is equal to 1024 MB. Therefore, you can say that **8 GB = 8 x 1024 = 8192 MB.**)_

As for **Processors** you want this to be at 2 and no more. Leave **Enable EFI (special OSes only)** as it is - that is **unchecked** - and click **Next** to continue.

#### Step 2.2.3: Virtual hard disk

   ![Don't Pre-allocate Full Size.](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/07_virtual_hard_disk.png)

Now, you want to leave all the settings as they are besides the **Disk Size**, we recommend giving the VM **at least 30GB** of space. Reminder that this disk will be created in the folder that you've specified on the very first step of the VM creation process but nonetheless, the disk can be moved and resized in the future if needed.


#### Step 2.2.4: Begin the unattended installation

Click **Next** to be taken to a **Summary** page, on which you can simply click **Finish** to begin the process of unattended installation. The neat thing about it? It installs the OS and GuestAdditions on its own, without your input! Just let it do its own thing, you will know it is finished when you will see a login screen like this one in the **Preview** section:

   ![The Preview section is in the top right of VirtualBox window.](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/08_preview_login.png)

Just click the green arrow called **Show** and you'll be presented with a VM window and the login screen. Log in with the password you've set up during the installation process and we'll have one bit of configuration left to do.

It is possible that you'll receive an error like this one after clicking **Finish**:

   ![The error shows up on the right side of the VirtualBox window and can be a little differently worded.](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/09_virtualization_error.png)

It means you have to [enable virtualization in your computer’s BIOS/UEFI settings](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/virtualization_deployment_and_administration_guide/sect-troubleshooting-enabling_intel_vt_x_and_amd_v_virtualization_hardware_extensions_in_bios). [Alternative set of instructions](https://2nwiki.2n.cz/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=75202968). If you have an AMD CPU, you're probably looking for something called `SVM` to enable, for Intel CPUs, `Intel Virtualization Technology`. The error should tell you what it is looking for. After you deal with it, just **Start** the machine and let things happen, you'll know that the process has finished when you see a login screen:

   ![You can already make your VM full screen or just maximize the window.](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/10_login_screen.png)


### Step 3: Setting correct sudo permissions

Due to how the unattended installation is configured by VirtualBox, your account doesn't have proper `sudo` permissions. Think of them as the equivalent to `Run as administrator` on your Windows machine - you can imagine why it would be important to have them in order.

#### Step 3.1: Navigate to users and group

First, click on the <img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/00_whisker_icon.png" alt="The blue-white rodent Whisker Menu Icon" style="display: inline; margin: auto;"> in top left of your window, afterwards type in `Users` and you should see `Users and Groups` show up. Click on it.

   ![It should be the top option you see. It is possible that due to localization it'll be called differently - try using the term in your language then.](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/11_users_and_groups.png)

#### Step 3.2: Manage groups

In the window that just came up you want to click on **Manage Groups**, click somewhere on the list and type `sudo` on your keyboard. That should bring you to the `sudo` entry like in the picture:

   ![You will find the search functionality like this in many corners of Xubuntu.](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/12_sudo_group.png)

#### Step 3.2: Add yourself to sudo

With `sudo` selected, click **Properties** and in the window that shows up tick your user's name like this:

   ![No need to touch anything else.](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/13_sudo_properties.png)

And then click **OK**. You will be greeted with a password prompt - it's the same one you logged in with.

#### Step 3.3: Reboot your VM

Now that this is all done, you can close those windows and reboot your VM. You can open a `Terminal` window by doing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> and type in `reboot` and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute the command. Alternatively, you can click on the <img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/00_whisker_icon.png" alt="The blue-white rodent Whisker Menu Icon" style="display: inline; margin: auto;"> , then click on the power icon in bottom right and pick **Restart**.

   ![You might want to take note of other options that you see in this menu.](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/14_logout.png)

   ![Not the most exciting of menus, but take note of the Shut Down option.](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/15_restart.png)

#### Step 3.4: Test your newly gained sudo privileges

Now that you have access to `sudo`, we can use this to update our Xubuntu through the `Terminal`. Open the `Terminal` and use these commands, one after another:

~~~bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
~~~

You will be asked for your password after using the first one - type it in and use <kbd>Enter</kbd> to provide your terminal with the password. There is no visual feedback about what you're typing in but you are indeed doing so.

After `sudo apt upgrade` runs for a while you will be asked whether you want to install things - do so to update your machine. If you have any issues, do not hesitate to come over to our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/V75WSQG) and ask for help in the `#virtualbox-help` channel.

### Step 4: Understand your new VM

Here are some tips to help you get started in a virtual environment:

-   Enable the toolbar in your VM settings - there are useful options there that you might want to play around with, especially the ones concerning full screen or multiple displays. To do so, click on **Settings** and then navigate to **User Interface** and finally tick **Show at Top of Screen**.
    ![It's a good idea to look around the settings overall to get a feel of what's possible.](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/16_toolbar.png)
-   All your work should happen in the VM. You will install everything you need for coding, including your text editor, language environments and various tools inside the VM. The Xubuntu installation inside of your VM also comes with a web browser pre-installed but we'll be installing Chrome shortly.
-   To install software on your VM, you will follow the Linux (Ubuntu) installation instructions from inside the Xubuntu VM.
-   You might need to take screenshots when asking for help on our Discord, here's how depending on where you use it:
    -   **Inside the VM:** you can use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>PrtSrc</kbd> to take screenshots of portion of your screen. Alternatively, you can click the **Whisker Menu** and type in **Screenshot**, in which you can choose to take a screenshot of your entire screen, the current window you are on or to select a certain area to capture.
    -   **On your host (Windows):** you can use a shortcut of the Host Key (<kbd>Right Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd>) or click **View -> Take Screenshot** for a full screenshot. A different way would be unfocusing your VM window by clicking outside of it and then using the regular Windows shortcut of <kbd>Windows key</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> to take screenshots of portion of your screen.
-   **Remember:** all of the development that you'll do related to TOP should be done in the VM.
-   We recommend going full screen (**View -> Full-screen Mode**) and forgetting about your host OS (Windows). For best performance, close all programs inside of your host OS when running your VM.
-   If you added additional monitors in the **Display** tab of your VM settings, with the VM running, clicking **View -> Virtual Screen 2 -> Enable**. You can run fullscreen with multiple monitors, but it may ask for more **Video Memory**, which you should have increased when adding more monitors. **Make sure you enable your Virtual Screens in windowed mode before going fullscreen, otherwise they won't work.** Upon exiting fullscreen, your secondary display may close. You can reopen it with these instructions.


#### Frequent issues/questions:

-   If upon trying to start the VM you only get a black screen, close and `power off` the VM, click **Settings -> Display** and make sure **Enable 3D Acceleration** is UNCHECKED, and Video memory is set to **AT LEAST 128MB**.
-   Running out of space? Look at [these instructions on our Discord](https://discord.com/channels/505093832157691914/690588860085960734/1015965403572351047).
-   Are you using a touchscreen? [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW-iyHHoDy4) on how to enable touchscreen controls for VirtualBox.
-   **VM performance tips**:
    -   When running the VM, minimize your Windows activity. You probably want to be plugged into power as well if you're using a laptop.
    -   Make sure your processors are set to only 2 and the Memory you've given your VM is at most half of your total RAM but at least 2GB. If you can't spare the 2GB, dual boot.
    -   If videos lag in the VM, make sure to max out Video Memory to whatever you can or alternatively play them on your Windows if your machine can handle it. Disable 3D Acceleration if you have it enabled.
    -   Do look out for the <img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/17_turtle.png" alt="Icon with a green turtle and a V" style="display: inline; margin: auto;"> icon in bottom right of your VM window, if you have it, here's a [VirtualBox forum thread on how to get rid of it](https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=99390). You want to have the <img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/18_vboxV.png" alt="Icon of a chip with a V" style="display: inline; margin: auto;"> icon instead. If you don't see a <img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/17_turtle.png" alt="Icon with a green turtle and a V" style="display: inline; margin: auto;"> or a <img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/18_vboxV.png" alt="Icon of a chip with a V" style="display: inline; margin: auto;"> in bottom right, you have to exit full screen mode to see them.
  -   If your performance is still lacking, go for a dual boot as this will make sure you're using all of your specs for one OS only, thus improving your experience significantly.
-   If your scroll wheel behaves oddly in Google Chrome and you have gone through VM performance tips to make sure your VM is working as intended, look into `imwheel`: [see these AskUbuntu instructions for more information](https://askubuntu.com/a/621140). If you have VSCode installed, use that instead of `gedit`, otherwise install it with `sudo apt install gedit` - if you install it with `snap`, it won't let you save the file. To make sure `imwheel` works every startup, you need to click the whisker <img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/00_whisker_icon.png" alt="The blue-white rodent Whisker Menu Icon" style="display: inline; margin: auto;"> , type `Session` and click on `Session and Startup` that shows up, go to `Application Autostart`, click `Add` and put it `imwheel` for `Name` and `imwheel -b "4 5` for `Command`. Click `OK` and you should be all set.

### Step 5: Safely shutting down your VM

You don't pull the plug on your everyday use computer, right? Why would you do the same to your virtual computer? When you click the X button and just close out your VM, you might as well say goodbye to your files. In this section, you'll understand three ways you can shut off your VM.

#### Option 1 - Shutting down from inside the VM with UI

Clicking on the **Whisker Menu** <img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/00_whisker_icon.png" alt="The blue-white rodent Whisker Menu Icon" style="display: inline; margin: auto;"> and clicking the power icon will give you several options on how to modify your session, including **Shutting Down**. Yep, that's the same place you might've used to **Restart** before!

#### Option 2 - Shutting down from inside the VM with the terminal

Simply enough, typing `poweroff` will do in this case. Your system will immediately shutdown.

#### Option 3 - Shutting down from outside the VM

The last way to accomplish this goal of safely shutting down is by using the VM interface. Clicking on the File tab and hitting the close button (which also has a Power Icon) will bring up a popup titled **Close Virtual Machine**. This popup asks if you want to **Save the machine state**, **Send the shutdown signal**, or **Power off the machine**.

![VM File Menu](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/96d534641514fe4d62aabe2919fac3c52cb286e7/foundations/installations/installations/imgs/19_vbox_close.png)

To be safe, click the **Send the shutdown signal** radio and hit OK. This will safely power down your VM and your files will not get corrupted.
