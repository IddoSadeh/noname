# Internet Basics 2

## Diving Deeper

Now that we've acquainted ourselves with some basic networking concepts and commands, let's dive deeper into the workings of the internet city.



2. **Subnetting and CIDR Notation:**
   - Subnetting is like dividing our city into various neighborhoods, making it easier to navigate. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a compact way to represent a neighborhood's address and size, like saying “The Elm Street Neighborhood covers buildings 1 to 100.”







## Address Resolution and Network Security

1. **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):**
   - We've already discussed ARP as the helper that finds a building's color (MAC Address) using its nameplate (IP Address). It's crucial for ensuring letters (data) reach the right buildings in our city.


3. **Network Adapter:**
   - The Network Adapter is like having a car or a bicycle that allows you to travel on the city's roads (network cables) and visit different buildings or send and receive letters.

<!-- 5. **Broadcast Address:**
   - Sometimes, you may want to invite all the  buildings on your street to a party. You use a special address, the Broadcast Address, to send out these invitations. All buildings on your street receive your invitation, and everyone is informed about the party. -->
