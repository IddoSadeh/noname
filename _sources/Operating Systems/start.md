   - **Learning and Contribution:** You can learn a lot about operating systems, software development, and open-source contribution by using and contributing to Linux projects.

3. **Cost-Effective:**
   - **Free to Use:** Most Linux distributions are free to use, which makes them a cost-effective alternative to other operating systems.
   - **Low Resource Requirement:** Linux can run on older and less powerful hardware, making it suitable for a wide range of systems.

4. **Security and Stability:**
   - **Secure:** Linux is known for being a very secure operating system, with a strong focus on user permissions and system resource management.
   - **Stable:** Linux systems are known for their stability and are capable of running for long periods without rebooting or crashing.

5. **Learning and Development:**
   - **Programming Environment:** Linux offers a powerful environment for programming, with a wide range of development tools available.
   - **Knowledge Transfer:** Learning Linux can help in understanding Unix and other Unix-like systems, which are widely used in enterprise environments.

6. **Diverse Range of Distributions:**
   - **Variety:** There are many different Linux distributions available, catering to different needs and preferences, from user-friendly ones like Ubuntu to more advanced ones like Arch Linux.
   - **Specialized Distributions:** Some distributions are tailored for specific purposes, such as data recovery, privacy, or multimedia production.

7. **Platform Independence:**
   - Linux can run on various hardware platforms, from personal computers to servers, mainframes, and embedded systems, making it versatile and widely applicable.

8. **Enhanced Privacy:**
   - Many Linux distributions have a strong focus on user privacy, which is becoming increasingly important in the digital age.

9. **Understanding of Computer Systems:**
   - Using Linux can provide a deeper understanding of computer systems, hardware, and operating systems, which can be especially beneficial for computer science students and enthusiasts.


**Kali Linux**

In the first sections of this textbook we will use a distribution called Kali Linux. Why?

Kali linux comes prepackaged with software intended for pentesting - authorized simulated attack performed on a computer system to evaluate its security. 

Most recommendations online (including the Kali team themselves) don't recommend Kali as an introduction to Linux, But the software available on Kali, can be utilized to learn about the internet, digital security, and digital privacy.
